### Mission description
VA256 is the 3rd launch of the Ariane 5 during the 2021 year. The objective of the flight was to place the James Space Telescope in transer orbit to Lagrange 2 point. It was Ariane's most valuable payload to date and one of the most important launch of the last decade for ArianeSpace and for scientists. Indeed, the telescope was intended as the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope (even if both are complementary) and is one of the most expensive human space missions ($ 10 Billion).
